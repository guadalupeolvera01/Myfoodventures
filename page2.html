        <h2> -Champions Pizza- </h2>
    
        <p> Come on down for a slice or pie of pizza. Not only are their delicious pizza is well recognized but the story behind who formed this company is very inspiring and they even have their own homemade marinara sauce. Many celebrities have came to one of NYC's pizza locations.
        </p>
    
    
    <p> Champions serves their pizza with fresh ingridients. Don't like soft crustes pizza? Don't eat meat? Lactose intolerant? </p>
        
    <p> Not to worry! - Champions pizza offers variety of pizza choices; from cheeseless pizza to pizza with only vegetables and crunchy crusted pizza. There are various locations but my favorite Champions pizza spot is in Astoria, Queens.  </p>
