        <p> My Favorites Menu:   </p>  
        
         <ul>
        
             <li>Takoyaki- If you like seafood and specially octopus then this is definitely worth a try for first timers on trying Japanese food as an apetizer. Contains; Wheat flour-based batter and cooked in a special molded pan and chopped octopus in a ball-shaped form.
             - WARNING! It is extremely hot from the inside. Takoyaki is shown above picture. </li>
             
             -

             <li>Gyudon Bowl- Not into seafood? Very hungry? 
             - No wormies, Gyudon bowls are a must have! And they serve a lot of rice and veggies and beef. As to why Gyudon really means (Beef Bowl). Contains; rice topped with beef and onion simmered in a mildly sweet sauce flavored with dashi and of your choice (soy sauce and mirin.)  </li>
        
            -
             
             <li>Pork amen- As you have probably heard of this famous dish already. I absolutely love ramen bowls in this restaurant, they give a large quantity for ramen lovers. Contains; Onion, soy sauce, shichimi togarashi (Japanese seasoning), ginger, noodles, garlic, egg, and thin slice pork.</li>
